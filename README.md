Here are all the steps I completed in Task 8.


step1= selected the database using "Use  library;"

step2= View existing tables by "SELECT * FROM author; SELECT * FROM book;

step3= I created a procedure to add a new author. 

step4= I created a funtion to  find fullname of user. I was not familiar with how to create a function, so I referred it from  ChatGPT.
